# When is gRPC a bad idea?

- Browser-based Web Applications: gRPC has limited browser support and requires additional infrastructure (gRPC-Web proxy) to work with browsers

- Public APIs: When you need to provide a public API that should be easily accessible to third-party developers who might prefer simpler REST APIs

- Simple CRUD Applications: When your application mainly performs basic create, read, update, and delete operations, REST might be simpler and more appropriate

- Small Applications: When building small applications where the overhead of setting up Protocol Buffers and gRPC infrastructure might outweigh the benefits

- Dynamic Data Structures: When your data structure changes frequently, as Protocol Buffers require recompilation and redeployment when schemas change

- External Client Integration: When clients need to integrate quickly without setting up complex tooling or learning new protocols
