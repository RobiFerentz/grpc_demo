# So when should I use gRPC?

- Service Integration: When integrating different systems that need strict contract enforcement and type safety

- Microservices Architecture: When you need fast, efficient communication between internal services, especially in polyglot environments where services are written in different languages

- Real-time Communication Systems: When you need bidirectional streaming and low latency, such as chat applications, gaming servers, or live tracking systems

- Mobile Applications and IoT Devices: When efficiency is key and when dealing with poor connections and latency.

- High-Performance Systems: When you need maximum performance with features like multiplexing, binary serialization, and HTTP/2 benefits
